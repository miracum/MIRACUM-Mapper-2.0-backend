# Open API Specification

The OpenAPI Specification is a standard for defining RESTful APIs. The specification is written in YAML and defines the endpoints, request and response objects, query and path parameters as well as the HTTP methods that can be used to interact with the API. The specification is used to generate boilerplate code for the server using [oapi-codegen]((https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen)
