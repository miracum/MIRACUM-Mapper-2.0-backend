# Development

The following sections will provide information on how to develop the project locally, how to run tests, how to run and debug the app locally and how the code is structured.

# Code Structure Overview

The `api` folder contains the OpenAPI specification file which documents the api and is also used to generate the server boilerplate code.

The `cmd` folder contains the main entrypoint for the application with the`main.go` file. There is also a `default-config.yaml` file containing default values to configure the service. These values are applied if the provided config file of the user doesn't include a value.

Documentation files for the development or database specific information is located in the `docs` folder.

The `tools` folder contains code generation tools like the `oapi-codegen` to generate the server boilerplate code.

The `test` folder contains the integration tests for the application.

The `internal` folder contains the main application code.

## Implementstion Go Code

The `iternal` folder is further subdivided into the following packages:

- `api`: contains the generated code from the OpenAPI specification file divided into `server_gen.go` and the `types_gen.go` code. The types define the request and response objects with structs while the server file includes the Gin router handlers and validation of the query and path parameters.

- `config`: contains the `Config` struct which holds all values related to configure the service externally by environment variables or the config file. The logic for loading the configuration file and environment variables as well as using default values if non are provided is handled here.

- `utilities`: hold different functions which are widely used accros all packages like generating UUIDs, loading environment variables, etc.

- `server`: `server.go` creates the server struct which implements the `StrictServerInterface` form the `api` package. Middlewares like authentication and rate limiting are implemented in the `middleware` directory. The other files hold the business logic of the endpoints. The files are divided in the same way as they are structured in the OpenAPI specification files. The files only hold the business logic and return the corresponding api responses (success or different errors depending on the specific endpoins). Database operations aren't implemented here in order to isolate the the database logic from the api business logic. The functions in the api endpoints only call generic operations defined in the `Datastore` interface from the `database` package or transform methods in order to transfrom API structs to their corresponding database ones. This also makes it easier to test the api endpoints without the need of a database. And the database and transform logic can be tested separately as well.

- `database`: The directory contains all database related operations. `datastore.go` defines the `Datastore` interface as well as `DatabaseErrors`. The interface capsulates all database logic so the defined functions can be called from the endpoints. The folder `gormQuery` is an implementation of the `Datastore` interface using GORM asn an ORM. Inside the `models` folder the GORM models are defined which specify the database tables and relations between them. `gormInit` is used to create a connection to the database and autoMigrate these models. In the `transform` directory the transformation between the API models and database models are defined at one central place.

# Tools and Code Generation

The `tools` directory contains tools and code generation scripts that are used to generate code for the project. In order to use these tools, just run this command:

```bash
cd tools
go generate -tags tools
```

## oapi-codegen

Boilerplate Code for the go server gets generated by [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen) version v2.1.0. The code generation is based on the OpenAPI specification file `api/openapi.yaml`. The generated code is placed in the `internal/api` directory. A `types_gen.go'`file gets generated defining the request and response objects of the OpenAPI files in Go structs. The `server_gen.go` file contains the Gin router handlers and validation of the query and path parameters.

# Development

The following section describes how to develop code for the project.

## Prerequisites

`Go 1.22` is used to develop the project so it has to be installed. `Make` has to be available to use the Makefiles for building the Application. Docker is necessary to run the application in an containerized environment and start the postgres database. In order to make the development process easiert in the future, a Dev Container will be provided which contains all necessary tools and dependencies so the project can be developed in a consistent environment.

## Running the Application

The application can be run locally using the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/miracummapper/main.go
```

When the applications starts, it waits until the database is reachable. The easiest way to create the postgres database is in an dockerized environment using the provided `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

To remove the database an its associated volume use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

There is also a `Makefile` defined to create the binary for a linux environment using the following command:

```bash
make
```

Also the docker image can be build locally using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t miracummapper .
```

# Dev Container

A Dev Container is provided to run the project in a containerized environment and make development easy as it has all prerequisites installed. To use it, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. The Dev Container Extension for VSCode is also recommended. Please refer to the [Dev Container Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) for more information.

# CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The project uses GitHub Actions as a CI/CD pipeline. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. Actions from the Miracum Project [.github](https://github.com/miracum/.github) repository are integrated to the workflow. The pipeline is divided into the jobs:

- `Static Code Analysis` is performed in the lint job using the Miracum Project `standard-lint.yaml` workflow. Additionally a `check-oapi-codegen` job is defined which checks if the generated code from the OpenAPI specification file is up-to-date with the spec file.

- `unit-test` are performed afterwards to test the individual functions of the application.

- TODO: `integration-test` will be added to test the application as a whole.

- In the `build` job the docker image is build, scanned and pushed to the GitHub Container Registry.
